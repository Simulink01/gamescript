# gamescript
A WIP Script to easily setup linux for gaming.
The goal of this project is to allow new users from windows systems
to not feel so overwhelmed and have an easy way to get gaming on linux
We currently support Ubuntu based distros and Archlinux

# Todo list
we are currently working on a way to install NVIDIA graphics drivers through the script.

# Installation-Ubuntu
###### Using git clone
```
git clone https://github.com/Simulink01/gamescript.git
cd gamescript
sudo bash gamescript.sh
```
# Installation-Arch
Our Archlinux script is still in heavy testing, and may not work with your system. Make sure you perform a full system upgrade before running this script.
###### Using git clone
make sure you have git installed by running ``sudo pacman -S git``
```
git clone https://github.com/Simulink01/gamescript.git
cd gamescript
sudo bash gamescript.sh
```

###### Using yay/other AUR helper
we are currently trying to get our package into the AUR

# Contributing
This project is very early in development, feel free to contribute anything to this project that you think will make it better.
Currently gamescript only supports Ubuntu and Archlinux, so the #1 thing needed to make this project better currently is support for more distros.
