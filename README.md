# gamescript
A WIP Script to easily setup linux for gaming.
The goal of this project is to allow new users from windows systems
to not feel so overwhelmed and have an easy way to get gaming on linux
We currently support Ubuntu based distros and Archlinux

# Installation
###### Using git clone
```
git clone https://github.com/Simulink01/gamescript.git
cd gamescript
sudo bash gamescript.sh
```

# Contributing
This project is very early in development, feel free to contribute anything to this project that you think will make it better.
Currently gamescript only supports ubuntu, so the #1 thing needed to make this project better currently is support for more distros.
